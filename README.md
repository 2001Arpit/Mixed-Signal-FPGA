# Mixed-Signal-FPGA

# Overview

This workshop is a continuation of the RVMYTH RISC-V core. Once we have made the RISC-V core, we will now implement it on an FPGA and test its functionality. This workshop aims to teach the following:
- Converting .tlv file to Verilog file
- Using iverilog for simulation.
- Using Vivado
- Using ILA (Integrated Logic Analyzer)
- Adding timing constraints
- Performing timing analysis
- False paths and true paths
- FPGA programming
